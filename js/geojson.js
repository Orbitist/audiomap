However, \u003Cstrong\u003ESeward\u003C\/strong\u003E did not yet have a deed for the house on North Portage Street, and the person who did own it still lived in Westfield.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe house eventually came into \u003Cstrong\u003ESeward\u2019s\u003C\/strong\u003E name as follows: It was constructed on a 1.5-acre lot on North Portage Street sold on 16 June 1831 from Benjamin \u003Cstrong\u003EEvans\u003C\/strong\u003E to the architect and builder John \u003Cstrong\u003EJones\u003C\/strong\u003E for $22 (\u003Cem\u003ELiber 12 Page 18\u003C\/em\u003E).

When his family moved to Hinsdale NY, George set off for Ohio, where he became a school teacher in Chillicothe. \u201cHe dressed in clerical black, and always carried a rifle and Bible,\u201d said \u003Cstrong\u003EFredrickson\u003C\/strong\u003E. \u201cHis height was estimated between 6\u00275\u0022 and 6\u00277.

He established a school for freed black children\u2026.\u201d\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGeorge joined the 73rd Infantry from Ohio and valiantly fought at Chancellorsville, Gettysburg and Lookout Mountain. \u201cHe became seriously ill with consumption and was hospitalized for several months,\u201d \u003Cstrong\u003EFredrickson\u003C\/strong\u003E said. \u201cThis condition would affect him for the remainder of his life. Unable to rejoin the 73rd, he was made a regimental band director when they realized that he was a musical genius\u2026. After George was discharged, he went to Nashville, Tennessee where he was hired at Fisk University\u2026.\u201d\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWell known as one of the HBCUs (Historically Black Colleges and Universities), Fisk\u2019s first classes began on 9 January 1866 and were made up of African Americans of all ages, many of them former slaves. The school was sponsored by the American Missionary Association and was named for the general who allowed use of the former Union Army barracks in Nashville. Music teacher George L. \u003Cstrong\u003EWhite\u003C\/strong\u003E was eventually named as treasurer of the fledgling school, and he used his own earnings to help support it. He and his most promising pupils established the Jubilee Singers, and to help the University financially, the group began touring on 6 October 1871.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first tour reputedly followed a route that had been part of the Underground Railroad through Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York. \u003Cstrong\u003EFredrickson\u003C\/strong\u003E said. \u201c[The group] overcame incredible obstacles. They were often denied hotel rooms and were banned in some places from using restaurant dining rooms. They were jeered and threatened by the Ku Klux Klan. In one city the female choir members were forced to sleep in a woodshed. They did not have proper clothing for inclement weather and George borrowed money to buy coats. One of the women was traveling wearing only cloth slippers.\u201d \u003Cstrong\u003EFredrickson\u2019s\u003C\/strong\u003E tales of the group\u2019s hardships are corroborated by \u003Cem\u003EDark Midnight When I Rise: the Story of the Jubilee Singers, who introduced the World to the Music of Black America\u003C\/em\u003E by Andrew \u003Cstrong\u003EWard\u003C\/strong\u003E (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, New York, NY, 2000).\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is evidence that the group came through Chautauqua County at least three times: during or prior to 1873, again in 1878, and again in 1881. In 1878, for example, the \u003Cem\u003EFredonia Censor\u003C\/em\u003E reported that the Jubilee Singers were in Fredonia and staying at the \u003Cstrong\u003ETaylor\u003C\/strong\u003E House inn, which was located on the site of today\u2019s 1 Park Place. This would indicate that at least in Fredonia, the group had become welcome by that time.

The original square house with rear extension is distinguished by its graceful cornice work. Broad curves in the cornice over the center of each face of the house are matched by the smaller, tighter curves in the cupola cornice\u2026. This house has front and side porches supported by columns with cast iron Corinthian capitals. Yellow and red stained glass windows and a hand painted frieze of birds on a dark wallpaper background can be seen inside the enclosed front porch.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cThe rear wing of the house contains the kitchen and pantry, with its built-in well and ice box. In contrast to the large brick with thin mortar joints found in the main section of the house, the brick in the rear section is smaller and more roughly laid. Yet, cast iron brackets under the eaves unify the two sections. A one-story brick addition tucked into the middle of the house on the north side shows a much plainer construction. Brick corbelling, like that used in commercial industrial buildings, has been substituted for a bracketed cornice.\u201d\u003C\/p\u003E\n\nSource: \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.mcclurgmuseum.org\/collection\/archives\/elial_t_foote_papers\/elial_t_foote_papers.html\u0022\u003Ethe Foote papers\u003C\/a\u003E"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.167652123427,42.543690331368]},"properties":{"name":"Nathaniel Gray","description":"\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/ugrr.orbitist.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/retina_600\/public\/station_master_photos\/SilverCreekVillage0387%5B1%5D.jpg?itok=9etx6_fv\u0022 data-lightbox=\u0022155\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http:\/\/ugrr.orbitist.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/retina_600\/public\/station_master_photos\/SilverCreekVillage0387%5B1%5D.jpg?itok=9etx6_fv\u0022\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/ugrr.orbitist.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/retina_600\/public\/station_master_photos\/35ParkPlaceSilverCreekHanoverThePresbyterianChurchPhoto4_0.jpg?itok=kg02S-gs\u0022 data-lightbox=\u0022155\u0022\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/ugrr.orbitist.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/retina_600\/public\/station_master_photos\/35ParkPlaceSilverCreekHanoverThePresbyterianChurchPhoto1.jpg?itok=_J-VwgM0\u0022 data-lightbox=\u0022155\u0022\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022author\u0022\u003EBy Douglas H.

After all the ill success with wich [\u003Cem\u003Esic\u003C\/em\u003E] I have met I still feel disposed to urge the necessity of a speedy decision which is very much wanting on the part of some \u2013 and which has caused such a delay.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cUnder the existing circumstances I have arrived at the conclusion to forward five dollars which I advance out of my own pocket to accommodate some that are anxious to obtain a liberty publication but have not the funds. I think there is no doubt but there are others that will contribute, \u00a0John \u003Cstrong\u003EMiller\u003C\/strong\u003E\u00a0 -\u00a0 1 , Wm \u003Cstrong\u003ESmith\u003C\/strong\u003E\u00a0 - 1, Daniel \u003Cstrong\u003EWallace\u003C\/strong\u003E\u00a0 - 1,\u00a0 Geo C \u003Cstrong\u003EPitcher\u003C\/strong\u003E\u00a0 - 2.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cI wish you to bear in mind that there are some others that have said they would take, but it is attended with uncertainty. There is one case I will mention one Mr Hiram \u003Cstrong\u003EShelters\u003C\/strong\u003E is a resident of this town but wants his paper sent to Elington [\u003Cem\u003Esic\u003C\/em\u003E] Can you send one there in case there is no more be left at that office.

Also, Orrin\u2019s and Miranda\u2019s son John may be the J. \u003Cstrong\u003EPitcher\u003C\/strong\u003E shown in Poland on the 1854 wall map of Chautauqua County.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\nSource: "}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.627232544876,42.273021977848]},"properties":{"name":"Jonathan Sackett Nichols","description":"\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/ugrr.orbitist.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/retina_600\/public\/station_master_photos\/JonathanSackettNichols%281804%20-%29.jpg?itok=Pez84ID6\u0022 data-lightbox=\u0022151\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http:\/\/ugrr.orbitist.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/retina_600\/public\/station_master_photos\/JonathanSackettNichols%281804%20-%29.jpg?itok=Pez84ID6\u0022\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/ugrr.orbitist.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/retina_600\/public\/station_master_photos\/WestfieldNorth0421%5B1%5D_2.jpg?itok=yAclulx3\u0022 data-lightbox=\u0022151\u0022\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/ugrr.orbitist.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/retina_600\/public\/station_master_photos\/8764Belson.jpg?itok=fjut_8WS\u0022 data-lightbox=\u0022151\u0022\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022author\u0022\u003EBy Douglas H.

T. \u003Cstrong\u003EFoote, \u003C\/strong\u003EDear Sir I believe now is the time Liberty men may most effectually spread their principles while the other parties are still. I know of no way those principles can be so advantageously spread as by our Publick [\u003Cem\u003Esic\u003C\/em\u003E] lectures \u0026amp; as every one ought to see that effectual means are employed in his immediate vicinity. I am anxious that we have a competent man discuss our principles in this place[.] I believe the people in the south part of our town are less under the influence of Political leaders than in the north and in the village 2 Locos [Loco-Foco Democrats] told me the other day they calculated to vote the Liberty ticket this spring.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cAs you gave some encouragement of speaking to us this winter it would be gratifying to me if you could make it convenient to do so[.]\u00a0 [O]ur numbers are so few \u0026amp; so recently enlisted it would not be advisable to attempt to reward a speaker[.]\u00a0 I therefore cannot urge your attendance. A friendly disposition is manifested from the Locos toward us in this place \u0026amp; as you were from their ranks probably no person could further the cause more in this place than yourself [.] If you come please come when we have a good Moon \u0026amp; give a notice of sufficient length that no other appointment interfere with yours \u0026amp; we will make an extra effort to get the people out[.] Mr. \u003Cstrong\u003EHungerford\u003C\/strong\u003E wished me to say to you he should like to have you come calculate to speak in the south part of Ripley[.] If you should fail to fulfil your appointment no person would be present to occupy the time.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cWe got 10 subscribers to the Congressional Patriot in this town[.] [O]ught to have had more.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cWho the Liberty candidate for the Presidency of 1848 in my mind is of great importance to the cause. We have run Mr. \u003Cstrong\u003EBirney\u003C\/strong\u003E twice \u0026amp; have been told by our opposers until a short time before election your cause is good but you can do nothing \u0026amp; if the time ever arrives when you can Mr. Birney will be set a side \u0026amp; some political demagogue will step in \u0026amp; take the office[.] I believe Mr. \u003Cstrong\u003EBirney\u003C\/strong\u003E has high claims for our support. He has suffered his name to run \u0026amp; withstood all the attacks the enemies of Liberty could make upon both his political \u0026amp; private character without the least expectation of being elected. Take any other man let the Whigs use half the ingenuity they did last fall I trust they will find some defect without forgiving it \u0026amp; I think it would leave an impression upon the publick that Liberty men endorsed some of these slanders \u0026amp; abandoned him. In my mind justice to Mr. \u003Cstrong\u003EBirney\u003C\/strong\u003E requires our support for him.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cWhen I compare the religious services of the present day with those before 1840 I perceive that the pulpit is muzzled \u0026amp; will not speak out against the great sin of our land because they say it is political. If so infidels have found how they can shut the ministers mouth \u0026amp; stop the progress of every religious enterprise[.] [O]nly take it into Politicks.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cFrom reading the report of the procedings [\u003Cem\u003Esic\u003C\/em\u003E] of the Anual [\u003Cem\u003Esic\u003C\/em\u003E] meeting of the board of Foreign missions I see there too more reverence is payed to Slavery than Liberty.

His father was Jeremiah \u003Cstrong\u003ELockwood\u003C\/strong\u003E; his mother was Amanda \u003Cstrong\u003ERawson\u003C\/strong\u003E, daughter of Safford \u003Cstrong\u003ERawson\u003C\/strong\u003E, an old resident of Schroon.

At the time of this removal Jeremiah jr. was a lad of about thirteen years, his birth having occurred May 17th, 1797. His mother was born in Schroon in the year 1800, and died at their home June 22nd, 1850, and his father died at the residence of Charles \u003Cstrong\u003EFowler\u003C\/strong\u003E, in Chestertown, Warren county, N.Y., April 19th, 1869.

There he raised his family of children, and they were educated principally in the common schools of the town. He also had a small farm on which he resided, and which he carried on by the aid of his children. Hotel keeping, at that time and place, was more of an accommodation to the public than of benefit to the owner, and but small profit was derived therefrom.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cClark R. remained at home until about sixteen years old, when he engaged with Jonathan \u003Cstrong\u003EStevens\u003C\/strong\u003E, of Castleton, Vt., as an apprentice at wagon-making, but remained only about two years, when, because of illness, he abandoned the enterprise and returned to his home. For several months he remained there and recruited, and then attended select school in Ticonderoga, N.Y., for about six months, and subsequently in Poultney, Vt., for several months. Then for a short time he engaged in teaching, after which he went to Chambly, Canada, to acquire a knowledge of the French language, and there obtained a situation in a French family, from whom he received instruction, but remained only about eight months, on account of sickness in his father\u2019s family. Being now about twenty-one years of age he again felt the necessity of choosing a business for life. He had no means except the little acquired from teaching. His health was poor, though improving, but, fully resolved upon making a \u201cstrike,\u201d he, through the assistance of Mr. A. R. \u003Cstrong\u003ECatlin\u003C\/strong\u003E, an old friend residing in Jamestown, obtained a situation as student in the law office of Mr. Orsell \u003Cstrong\u003ECook\u003C\/strong\u003E, a leading lawyer in western New York.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cHe taught school during the winter of 1848-49 and with the wages thus earned he paid a few debts, bought a small amount of clothing, and with the remainder, less than $20, he left his home about August 23d, 1849, for the office of Mr. \u003Cstrong\u003ECook\u003C\/strong\u003E in Jamestown, where he commenced reading \u003Cem\u003EBlackstone\u003C\/em\u003E.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cFor a time he resided in the family of Mr. \u003Cstrong\u003ECook\u003C\/strong\u003E, doing chores to pay his board, but finding it necessary to replenish his funds, he engaged in teaching in the old \u201cPine street school-house\u201d for the term of six months, and during that time wrote for the office, boarded himself, and kept up his law reading. In the fall and winter of 1852-53 he attended the \u003Cstrong\u003EFowler\u003C\/strong\u003E Law School, at Ballston Spa, N.Y., and in the spring of 1853 was admitted to practice at a General Term of the Supreme Court, held at Buffalo.

After his marriage he returned to the office of Mr. \u003Cstrong\u003ECook\u003C\/strong\u003E, and, after a few months, formed a law partnership with Mr. W. M. \u003Cstrong\u003ENewton\u003C\/strong\u003E, with whom he continued practicing his profession under the name of \u003Cstrong\u003ELockwood\u003C\/strong\u003E \u0026amp; \u003Cstrong\u003ENewton\u003C\/strong\u003E down to about August 25th, 1855, at which time he and Mr. \u003Cstrong\u003ECook\u003C\/strong\u003E entered into partnership under the firm name of \u003Cstrong\u003ECook\u003C\/strong\u003E \u0026amp; \u003Cstrong\u003ELockwood\u003C\/strong\u003E.

In politics he was reared a Democrat, but as time advanced and party agitation developed the evils of slavery he felt it his duty to, and did, follow the leading thought of the country in protesting against slavery\u2019s assumed right of extension. He aided in the formation of the Republican party of his county, the fundamental principles of which he has ever cherished, and with the advocates of which he is yet identified. Although an active worker for the promotion of his principles he has not been an office seeker. In religious convictions he is a Universalist, liberal in thought and tolerant toward others. He has two children living, Olive Amanda, wife of Abner E. \u003Cstrong\u003EAllen\u003C\/strong\u003E, and Clark Wheeler [\u003Cstrong\u003ELockwood\u003C\/strong\u003E]. A daughter, Lizzie W., died several years since. He is yet active in his professional labors, and his promptness at the \u2018post of duty\u2019 evidences his will to do while there is work to be done.\u201d\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELockwood\u003C\/strong\u003E continued to live in Jamestown.

However, he built a mansion on South Main Street (Warren Street) on the site of the former Rev. Chapin home. The 1900 Census gave his home address as 107 Warren Street.

However, they\u00a0probably relocated to Chautauqua County shortly thereafter, because the records of the Fredonia NY Academy note that \u003Cstrong\u003EThompson\u2019s\u003C\/strong\u003E son \u201cDexter B. \u003Cstrong\u003EThompson\u003C\/strong\u003E of Portland NY\u201d was a student in Fredonia in 1845 and 1846 and the 1850 Census showed \u003Cstrong\u003EThompson\u003C\/strong\u003E and his family in Salem X Roads.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00a0The 1850 census listed James \u003Cstrong\u003EThompson\u003C\/strong\u003E (age 61), Hannah \u003Cstrong\u003EThompson\u003C\/strong\u003E (52), Caroline \u003Cstrong\u003EThompson\u003C\/strong\u003E (18), Marcus \u003Cstrong\u003EThompson\u003C\/strong\u003E (14), and Adaline \u003Cstrong\u003EThompson\u003C\/strong\u003E (8).

He was identified in 1850 as a \u201cclerk,\u201d and for the 1870 Census he gave his occupation as a \u201cmason.\u201d It is also interesting that on 17 July 1854, the \u003Cstrong\u003EThompsons\u2019\u003C\/strong\u003E daughter Caroline married Edgar \u003Cstrong\u003ECromwell\u003C\/strong\u003E of Elmira NY, because there had been a number of \u003Cstrong\u003ECromwell\u003C\/strong\u003E families listed in Sherburne at the time that the \u003Cstrong\u003EThompsons\u003C\/strong\u003E were living there.

Her husband died soon after and she was left alone to support and train her children. How thoroughly this was done may be inferred from the fact that though forced to earn their breed by her work as a seamstress, she brought them up to fear God and love their country and their fellowman. She also gave them all a common school education and the three boys received trades.

As was often the case in the nineteenth century, the girls\u2019 names were given differently in different censuses. In 1860 Olive became Cecille; Mariah became Isabelle; and Georgiana became Georgia. Olive (Cecille) married J. W. \u003Cstrong\u003EWeller\u003C\/strong\u003E; Maria married A.

Bailey, p.73. \u201cIt is reported that there was an Underground Railroad station also at Falconer. Bert Mosher relates that when in 1860 his father moved into the old Edward Work house, which formerly stood on the corner now [1934] occupied by the Falconer Bank, there was a room on the second floor, the only access to which was a very skillfully concealed entrance from above. The general supposition has been that this concealed room was used for secreting slaves who came to the place as an Underground Railroad station. The existence of this station, however, cannot be definitely established.\u201d However, the anti-slavery activist Dr. Elial Foote wrote a biographical account of Edward Work, whom he had known for 40 years as a friend and a medical patient. Work was born in Montgomery Twp. PA on 3 December 1773. He read law and then moved to Meadville around 1798. On 1 August 1807 with his friend Dr. Thomas R. Kennedy he bought some 1200 acres around the outlet of Chautauqua Lake. In the fall of 1807 and spring of 1808 he \u201cerected his hewed log block house on the north side of the outlet, a little northeast of the mill, where he resided until he erected the frame house where he died. About the year 1836, he sold his mills and real estate at Worksburg, except his family residence, and a few acres of contiguous land, and retired from the bustle of active life, having a competence for himself and family. His declining years were spent in retirement, mingling but little with society.\u201d\u00a0\u003C\/p\u003E\n\nSource: \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.co.chautauqua.ny.us\/departments\/clerk\/historian\/Documents\/The%20Underground%20Railroad%20in%20Chautauqua%20County\/TheUndergroundRailroadInChautauquaCounty.pdf\u0022\u003ESelected excerpts from sources\u003C\/a\u003E"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-78.9871,42.3398]},"properties":{"name":"James Wells","description":"\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/ugrr.orbitist.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/retina_600\/public\/station_master_photos\/WellsJamesImage1.jpg?itok=XGJLdhKA\u0022 data-lightbox=\u002261\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http:\/\/ugrr.orbitist.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/retina_600\/public\/station_master_photos\/WellsJamesImage1.jpg?itok=XGJLdhKA\u0022\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/ugrr.orbitist.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/retina_600\/public\/station_master_photos\/WellsJamesImage2.jpg?itok=tYLiJxRs\u0022 data-lightbox=\u002261\u0022\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/ugrr.orbitist.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/retina_600\/public\/station_master_photos\/WellsJamesImage3.jpg?itok=nDhDbYe4\u0022 data-lightbox=\u002261\u0022\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/ugrr.orbitist.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/retina_600\/public\/station_master_photos\/WellsResidenceInLeonReduced%5B1%5D.jpg?itok=7xTUMnJu\u0022 data-lightbox=\u002261\u0022\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022author\u0022\u003EBy Douglas H.

Mr. Stafford well remembered the frequent signal at the door during the night and of hearing his stepfather open the door and admit the conductor and his party. With the curiosity of a boy, young Stafford often stole down to see the strange visitors whom he recalls as extremely shy and in constant dread of capture. After the slaves had been fed by Mr. Stafford\u2019s mother [Polly Stafford Nessel], Mr. Nessle would immediately harness his horses and the same night drive on to the next station which was conducted by James Wells two miles north of Leon Center. The Leon station was in a more secluded location and the slaves could be secreted there during the day with greater security. Mr. Stafford\u2019s only knowledge of the route beyond Leon was that it led to Buffalo.\u201d\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere were three Stafford stepsons living in the Nessel family in the 1850s and 1860s, Austin, Joseph and Martin.

There are a few other clues in Pettit\u2019s account as to \u201cfriend Andrew\u2019s\u201d age and location. On p.14 of the 1999 annotated edition by Paul Leone, Friend Andrew has arrived at Black Rock by carriage, carrying \u201cDan,\u201d a runaway slave. Andrew is wearing a hat with \u201ca broad brim,\u201d and Pettit refers to him as an \u201cold man.\u201d That was in January 1858.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOn p.17 we follow a refugee\u2019s route from Warren PA, Jamestown, Ellington and Leon to Pettit\u2019s station in Versailles. The fugitive, Tom Stowe, immediately left Pettit\u2019s place, forded the river (Cattaraugus Creek) \u201cand going through the dark woods (a horrible road in those days) arrived before daylight at Friend Andrew\u2019s hospitable station\u2026.Another idle day was passed and the next morning Andrew put him on a boat at Black Rock.\u201d In other words, Friend Andrew lived close enough to Black Rock to reach it quickly in the morning.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOn p. 94 Pettit describes the refugees William and Margaret Holmes leaving Fredonia at 3 p.m. in deep snow and cold temperatures. They were brought to the Versailles station and then \u201cfound themselves rising the east bank of the Cattaraugus Creek (the crossing was on the ice, there being no bridge at that time), on the way to friend Andrew\u2019s station.\u201d\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf we put those clues together with some external evidence, we find that the most likely candidate is Andrew Varney of the small settlement called Pontiac in Evans township in Erie County, New York. Andrew Varney was born in Berwick ME on 27 March 1797 to Joshua and Anne Varney. He and his family were there in 1820 and in Porter, Oxford ME at the time of the 1830 Census. By 1840 they were in Evans NY where they continued to live. Andrew Varney\u2019s house can be seen in the \u201cPontiac\u201d section in the 1866 atlas of Erie County in the Maps Division of the New York Public Library. He died in Pontiac on 27 October 1868 and was buried in the North Collins Quaker cemetery.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere was a Quaker census done in 1828 to record the names of members of the New York yearly meetings of the Religious Society of Friends at the time of a schism between \u201cHicksites\u201d and \u201cOrthodox\u201d Quakers. Andrew Varney\u2019s involvement can be traced from his membership in the Troy-Pittstown meeting of 1819. On 1 September 1824 he became a member of the Starksborough monthly meeting and on 1 April 1825 he was married at the Hamburg monthly meeting to Mary Stevens.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETheir son, Austin F. \u201cJames\u201d Varney was born in Brant NY in 1828. He hosted Sojourner Truth in his home in 1868. A narrative of that visit was written by Phebe Merritt Varney. She was 29, living with her parents, Isaac and Mary Varney in North Berwick ME in 1850. By 1860 she was living with James Varney, listed as a \u201cdomestic,\u201d although she may already have been married to him. There was a \u201cMart [Merritt] Varney,\u201d six years old in the family as well. The family is the same in 1870, but the 1880 Census has James and \u201cP. Varney\u201d as well as Merritt, 26, and Pauline Varney, 40. The 1866 Evans map shows Jas. A. F. Varney on Mileblock Road (Lot 12) with a lot assigned to M. F. Varney across the way.

R. Houck (\u003Cem\u003EThe Legacy ...\u003C\/em\u003E, iUniverse, Inc. 2003). Houck suggests that Aaron had owned a log house on the site and operated a tavern there for a few years prior to 1826, and in 1826 he tore down the house and erected the structure later called Chicken Tavern. It is certain that Aaron was in the county in 1825 (he is in the 1825 census) and the 1820 census lists Aaron in Covington, Genesee county in February of 1821. Aaron\u0027s brother Levi Town (1797-1887) settled there permanently, where Levi and his two wives are buried. Aaron and Lucina\u0027s son Martin Hiram Town\u0027s obituary also suggests that it was 1824 or 1825 when the family arrived in Arkwright (\u003Cem\u003EThe Fredonia Censor\u003C\/em\u003E). Further supporting the date, daughter Clarissa L. Town Spencer Morey\u0027s (1824-1908) obituary states that she was born in Solon in what is now Cortland county in 1824 (Dunkirk Observer 6 May 1908). The Underground Railroad activity of Aaron Town is also cited by D. R. Houck. Adding to the likelihood of such activity is the fact that Aaron\u2019s wife was the daughter of Clarissa Holbrook Harvey, who was connected to the anti-slavery Holbrook family in the Randolph and Waterboro area of western New York.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\nSource: \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.co.chautauqua.ny.us\/departments\/clerk\/historian\/Documents\/The%20Underground%20Railroad%20in%20Chautauqua%20County\/TheUndergroundRailroadInChautauquaCounty.pdf\u0022\u003ESelected excerpts from sources\u003C\/a\u003E"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.129,42.0719]},"properties":{"name":"Hiram Evelyn Thayer","description":"\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/ugrr.orbitist.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/retina_600\/public\/station_master_photos\/ThayerImage1.jpg?itok=5NjjgrwB\u0022 data-lightbox=\u002254\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http:\/\/ugrr.orbitist.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/retina_600\/public\/station_master_photos\/ThayerImage1.jpg?itok=5NjjgrwB\u0022\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022author\u0022\u003EBy Douglas H.

He moved with his parents to Cazenovia NY in 1808, attended the commons schools and was apprenticed to a harness maker and saddler. In December 1822 he began working for William Knight in Jamestown NY. He was in the military company that greeted LaFayette at Fredonia in 1824, and in 1825 Silas is said to have come to Fredonia (when he was 21), but in 1827 he returned to Jamestown and opened a harness and saddler shop at the corner of Main and Third streets. One of his later apprentices was John P. Shearman. On 29 March 1829 he married Mary C. Marsh, originally from Vermont. They lived their entire married life in Ellicott. An online post says he \u201cwas a democrat until the close of the Polk administration [1849], when he became an Abolitionist, and acted as a conductor on the underground Railroad, assisting slaves to reach Canada.

In the 1850s he became a conductor of the \u2018underground railroad\u2019 and his home was the principle station in Jamestown. It was not uncommon for him to come down in the morning and find his kitchen filled with escaping slaves who were brought to Jamestown during the night and directed to his home. He would feed them and hid[e] them during the day in his barn on Stillers Alley and then arrange for their transportation to the next station, often in the village of Ellington.\u201d \u201cHe was also active in the cause of temperance.

The transaction was part of a complicated deal in which Redington deeded his house on Mechanic Street (today\u2019s Forest Place) and his hardware store in the Woleben Block on Main Street to Curtis for $4500.

It enables me to live over again the days when slavery began to find a voice here and there bold enough to condemn it and endure the scoffs of popular opinion which proclaimed slavery a divine institution from both platform and pulpit. I am reminded of an incident which occurred in Westfield fifty-five years ago when Rev. D. D. Gregory\u00a0 gave notice from the pulpit that on Monday evening there would be a meeting in the conference room of the church to organize an \u201canti-Slavery Society.\u201d At the time appointed a lad of sixteen winters and fifteen summers found the Rev. Gregory and another \u201ccontemptible abolitionist\u201d standing at the door which had been locked by order of the deacons who \u201cwould not consent to such desecration of God\u2019s House.\u201d The lad crawled into an unfastened window and admitted the crowd of two persons. The society was organized and officers chosen consisting of President, Secretary and Treasurer. The society grew and multiplied; the U.G.R.R. was constructed; political parties were rent asunder; the rail road trains ran noiselessly whenever there were one or more passengers. Canada was the Ark of safety to which the slave ran for dear life, and those who abetted their escape were criminals in the eyes of the law.What a lever that U.G.R.R. proved to be. It excelled the fancies of Archimedes. Three millions of broken yokes. Three millions of bondsmen set free. Forever sacred be the memory of Conductor Pettit and his co-workers. Yours Truly. F. A.

Still, it is interesting to consider Ms. \u003Cstrong\u003EPelton\u2019s\u003C\/strong\u003E family connections to the anti-slavery society of 1839. First of all, Ms. \u003Cstrong\u003EPelton\u003C\/strong\u003E had grown up at today\u2019s 245 Chestnut Street, the home of her parents, Fred Fay \u003Cstrong\u003EFrost\u003C\/strong\u003E (\u003Cem\u003E1883 - 1953\u003C\/em\u003E) and May \u003Cstrong\u003EFrost\u003C\/strong\u003E (\u003Cem\u003E1879 - 1964\u003C\/em\u003E).

A notice was given requesting those in \u201cfavor\u201d of such a measure to meet at a place appointed. It appearing, however, from various demonstrations, there would be a goodly number present who were not in favor of the measure, those friendly to the subject formed themselves into an anti-slavery society at another place, and then proceeded to ______ first designated place, where they in fact found a well filled room \u2013 officers appointed to their hands, and all things ready to proceed to business.

The ____ stepped out upon the floor to receive the reprimand, which placed the chairman in rather a quandary, and the reprimand was suffered to go by default. The meeting soon after broke up, both sides considering that they had carried their points.

Their \u201ccottage\u201d was next door to the large home of Rossiter P. Johnson, a lawyer. It was in the spring of 1841 that she was sent to the Johnson home on an errand and saw some twenty or thirty escaped slaves being fed by Mrs. Johnson. The clear implication was that Mrs. Johnson\u2019s husband was complicit in having his house function as a station on the Underground Railroad. In 1939, Elijah W. Holt wrote an article entitled \u201cWhere Stands our High School\u201d for the \u003Cem\u003EWestfield Republican\u003C\/em\u003E.

His father, Jonathan \u003Cstrong\u003EHedges\u003C\/strong\u003E, was born on Long Island in 1772; removed with his father\u2019s family to Saratoga county, N.Y., where in 1809 he married Miss Elizabeth \u003Cstrong\u003ESears\u003C\/strong\u003E. They had four children: Elias Sears, William Smith, Ruth Eliza (died in infancy), and Henry Baker. In 1819 they removed to Meadville, Pa., where the mother soon afterward died; and the father returned at once with his children to the old farm near Ballston Spa. He afterward married Miss Lucy \u003Cstrong\u003ESherman\u003C\/strong\u003E, and in May of 1820 they settled in Sinclairville, Chautauqua county, N.Y.

Henry B. \u003Cstrong\u003EHedges\u003C\/strong\u003E was a physician, and died in Sinclairville in 1848, aged thirty-one. He had begun a career of great promise, and was universally esteemed.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cDr. W. S. \u003Cstrong\u003EHedges\u003C\/strong\u003E was born June 6th, 1814, and after receiving a good academic education studied medicine with Dr. \u003Cstrong\u003ECopp\u003C\/strong\u003E, who was then practicing his profession in Sinclairville, and graduated at Fairfield Medical College in Herkimer county, N.Y., in 1837. The same year he was married to Miss Emily \u003Cstrong\u003ETracy\u003C\/strong\u003E of Ithaca, N.Y., who died in September, 1838, in Jamestown. He married, September 12th, 1839, Miss Theda C. \u003Cstrong\u003EParker\u003C\/strong\u003E, of Jamestown, born in Mount Morris, Livingston county, N.Y., May 15th, 1819, the fourth daughter of Luther and Martha \u003Cstrong\u003ECurtis\u003C\/strong\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EParker\u003C\/strong\u003E, who came from Granville, Washington county, N.Y. to western New York in 1806, before there was a town on the west side of the Genesee river except Buffalo and Batavia.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cFrom July, 1838, he resided in Jamestown, and continued in active practice until ill-health compelled him to retire almost entirely from business. After eight years of allopathic practice, he was among the first to recognize the merits of homoeopathy, and from 1844 he universally practiced it. He was in partnership with Dr. Samuel \u003Cstrong\u003EFoote\u003C\/strong\u003E for four years from May, 1838, and with Dr. A. W. \u003Cstrong\u003EGray\u003C\/strong\u003E for twelve years from 1845. As a physician he was clear in diagnosis and skillful in choice of remedies. His relations with physicians of all the schools were always of the most friendly character. His sympathy with children brought much love in return, and he was often called \u2018the children\u2019s doctor.\u2019\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHe was a thorough anti-slavery man, and always upheld the principles of the Republican party. Early in life he confessed his faith in Christ, and for thirty-eight years was a member of the First Presbyterian Church of Jamestown. A man of few words, his quiet, simple, life testified to the inner Christian life. After an invalid life of seventeen years (rendered almost happy by his cheerful spirit) he died July 5th, 1878.\u201d\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAccording to the 1850 Census, Dr. \u003Cstrong\u003EHedges\u003C\/strong\u003E, his wife, Theda, and daughter Janet were living in the household of Elihu George \u003Cstrong\u003ECook\u003C\/strong\u003E, also a physician, his wife, Salina, and son Elliot. Interestingly the census entries also include as immediate neighbors three other physicians, a druggist, and two clergymen, possibly suggesting some kind of health care center. The 1854 wall map of Chautauqua County includes an inset for Jamestown, listing some of the businesses and professions there at the time. However, there was a fee for being named on the map and, unfortunately, Dr. \u003Cstrong\u003EHedges\u2019\u003C\/strong\u003E name does not appear at that early time. He did not appear in the physicians\u2019 listings in the 1867 county atlas, either, which may explain why his family made sure that Dr. \u003Cstrong\u003EHedges\u003C\/strong\u003E appeared in the 1881 atlas, even though he was deceased by that time.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\nSource: \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.co.chautauqua.ny.us\/departments\/clerk\/historian\/Documents\/The%20Underground%20Railroad%20in%20Chautauqua%20County\/TheUndergroundRailroadInChautauquaCounty.pdf\u0022\u003ESelected excerpts from sources\u003C\/a\u003E"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.2421,42.1]},"properties":{"name":"Catherine Dickes Harris","description":"\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/ugrr.orbitist.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/retina_600\/public\/station_master_photos\/HarrisImage2.jpg?itok=PSxmSOF3\u0022 data-lightbox=\u002230\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http:\/\/ugrr.orbitist.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/retina_600\/public\/station_master_photos\/HarrisImage2.jpg?itok=PSxmSOF3\u0022\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/ugrr.orbitist.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/retina_600\/public\/station_master_photos\/HarrisImage1.jpg?itok=4HqfrIdl\u0022 data-lightbox=\u002230\u0022\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022author\u0022\u003EBy Douglas H.

The minutes of Session of the Ripley Presbyterian Church in 1836 twice note that a committee looking into Harvey Hall\u2019s \u201ccase\u201d had not seen him to interview him. The entry of 20 November 1837 records that from the committee\u2019s interview with him \u201cthey are somewhat encouraged that he would return to his duty and that no further evidence of his secreting persons escaping from justice has been obtained.\u201d Although it is not specified, his error may have been related to Underground Railroad activity, although other Presbyterian congregations in Chautauqua County at this same time are thought to have been sympathetic to the anti-slavery movement. Since Hall remained in the church, it would seem that either he did not continue as a conductor or stationmaster after 1837, or he rallied other church members to his cause. Harvey Hall and Harvey Hall, Jr. are both found in the 1850 Census but only Harvey Hall, Jr. is listed in the 1855 and later censuses.

Shults, \u003Cem\u003ECherry Creek Illustrated: A History, 1900\u003C\/em\u003E. \u201cFrost lived in the Village until about 1839, when he purchased a large farm situated in a pleasant valley about two miles northwest of the Village on the Fredonia road. His near neighbors were Anson Newton, Harvey Putnam, Ira B. Turner and Elkeny Steward. Mrs. Frost was born in the State of Rhode Island June 25, 1803, and died at Cherry Creek May 27, 1889, surviving him 17 years. Of their marriage twelve children were born.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022George H. Frost was a man of strong earnest conviction. Human slavery disturbed the peace and threatened the destruction of the Union. From the time Mr. Frost became old enough to take an interest in public affairs, he was uncompromisingly opposed to the institution of slavery. His entire being revolted at this monster. No subject of public concern affected him more intensely. He believed that this government founded on the equal rights of men could not long survive with slavery. His opposition to it was outspoken, earnest, and active. He early allied himself with the Abolition party, in fact when it required no small degree of moral courage to take a position in the ranks of that despised political sect.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022His great opportunities for usefulness to the cause, in his poverty in the wilderness of Western New York, were small compared to those of the leaders of the cause, but he belonged to, and for a long time was actively engaged in the services of the Underground Railroad so-called, and many a fugitive slave was assisted by him on his secret journey in his effort to escape bondage to Canada. In his house he sheltered and fed alike the traveler and the fugitive slave.\u201d\u003C\/p\u003E\n\nSource: \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.co.chautauqua.ny.us\/departments\/clerk\/historian\/Documents\/The%20Underground%20Railroad%20in%20Chautauqua%20County\/TheUndergroundRailroadInChautauquaCounty.pdf\u0022\u003ESelected excerpts from sources\u003C\/a\u003E"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.1387,42.5195]},"properties":{"name":"Alonzo Frink","description":"\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/ugrr.orbitist.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/retina_600\/public\/station_master_photos\/FrinkImage1.jpg?itok=2sVeNXji\u0022 data-lightbox=\u002222\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http:\/\/ugrr.orbitist.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/retina_600\/public\/station_master_photos\/FrinkImage1.jpg?itok=2sVeNXji\u0022\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022author\u0022\u003EBy Douglas H.

His anti-slavery activity was cited in the \u003Cem\u003EJamestown Morning Post\u003C\/em\u003E July 18, 1923 in the reprint of an 1891 story by Palmer K. Shankland. George A. French, son of Asa and Jane French, was born in Massachusetts in August 1798. The family moved to Fredonia by 1810. The Pomfret census for that year lists \u201cA. French\u201d in a family of four: one male 10 to 15, one male 16 to 25, one male 26 to 44, and one female 26 to 44. The other boy is probably the Asa French who died on 1 March 1826, age 25. Young\u2019s \u003Cem\u003EHistory\u003C\/em\u003E (p.471) notes that Asa French was the first blacksmith in Fredonia, with his home and shop on the corner of today\u2019s West Main and Chestnut streets across from Richard Williams\u2019 inn. Jane died on 14 January 1813, age 41, and Asa promptly married Mary Spencer on 28 March of that year.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhether it was a motivating factor or not, after Jane died in 1813, Asa gave up the West Hill location and moved to Sheridan. In 1814 he was in the east part of 61-6-11\u00a0 and in 1815 he had 100 acres in the southwest part of 54-6-11. The size of his parcel suggests he was farming, perhaps combining it with blacksmithing. Although their property was in Sheridan, Asa and Mary continued as members of the Fredonia Congregational church, which changed to Presbyterian in 1817, The assessment rolls show Asa French still in Sheridan with some 95 acres in 1819, reduced to 35 acres in 1820 when his son George is listed with the other 35 acres on Lot 54. By 1821 Asa\u2019s name disappears from all records and George has all 70 acres on Lot 54, which continues into 1826. In addition to farming,\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGeorge must have worked for a merchant during this period since he had enough experience to be able to join with young Walter Smith in opening a store in Sinclairville in 1824. Smith, then just 24, had been apprenticed to Jacob TenEyck in Cazenovia in 1815 and proved so able that TenEyck bankrolled him when he opened a store of his own in Fredonia in 1819, when Smith was all of 19 years old. (Smith had purchased the store and ashery of Joseph and Ralph Plumb, who had gone bankrupt.)\u00a0 In 1825, the Baptist minister Joy Handy joined them as French, Handy \u0026amp; Co. (The \u201c\u0026amp; Co.\u201d was Walter Smith.) That partnership was dissolved in 1828.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough the Sinclairville store was robbed in 1825, George A. French must have done well enough that on 23 May 1826 he and Walter Smith announced their new partnership in a store in Dunkirk. The assessment roll for 1827 shows George A. French with properties listed as 9 \u0026amp; 10 Front Street (1\/3 acre), 1 Buffalo Street (\u00bc acre), and 24 Front Street (1\/16 acre). It seems to be the 1 Buffalo Street (Washington Avenue) location that was French\u2019s Dunkirk home, noted only as \u201chouse\u201d or \u201cDwelling\u201d in the assessment rolls through 1844. In 1850 it is referred to in parentheses as the Pemberton House.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGeorge A. French was elected Town Supervisor in 1830 through 1833. On 14 November 1831 French\u2019s wife, Sophia Risley, died and on 25 December 1832 he married Mrs. Sally (Hudson) Day of Dunkirk. She had been a founding member of the Dunkirk Presbyterian Church in 1830. In 1834 he joined. In 1835 he was one of twelve leading citizens who organized the Dunkirk Academy, which opened on 23 September with George A. French as one of the three Trustees. The village of Dunkirk was incorporated in 1837 with Walter Smith as it first president. However, the panic of 1837 devastated the village\u2019s economy, with many businesses forced into foreclosure. It was in May of 1837 that \u201cGeorge A. French \u0026amp; Co.\u201d announced themselves as successors to \u201cJ. Beggs \u0026amp; Co.\u201d which probably included the docks at the foot of Buffalo Street and Center Street.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 1838 French was elected to the NY State Assembly and again in 1840 and 1841. The assessment rolls continue to show him as a prosperous property owner in addition to the important local power he had become. That was his status in September 1851, when he is recorded as receiving a telegraph message from Silas Shearman, an active member of the Underground Railroad in Jamestown, requesting urgent help in rescuing a re-captured refugee slave. The published account of this incident referred to French as \u201ca prominent and zealous Abolitionist.\u201d Shearman knew that \u201cGeorge A. French would arouse the friends of anti-slavery in the vicinity of Dunkirk and \u2026 would give him every possible assistance.\u201d If it were not for this one recorded episode, we would have little record that French had been anything but a popular, successful local businessman.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFrench\u2019s second wife, Sally, had died on 8 March 1851 some months before the dramatic incidents described. On 8 January 1852 he married Sarah A. Stillman of Wethersfield CT, possibly related to The Rev. Timothy Stillman of the Dunkirk Presbyterian Church. For some reason, French apparently sold his properties. His name disappears from the assessment rolls, although he is still in Dunkirk at the time of the 1860 Census. He died in Fredonia on 29 January 1865 and was buried in Forest Hill Cemetery.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe record of George A. French\u2019s children is not entirely clear, although there are records for at least four. The 1850 Census, the first to list all family members\u2019 names, shows a daughter, Ann, eight years old. The family is omitted from the 1855 Census for some reason and there is no later mention of Ann in any of the public records. \u003Cem\u003EThe Fredonia Censor\u003C\/em\u003E of 6 January 1841 reported that Delia French \u201cdaughter of George A. French,\u201d married Silas Seymour on 23 December 1840. Francis A. (Asa) French married Juliett Spencer on 11 September 1843, according to \u003Cem\u003EThe Fredonia Censor\u003C\/em\u003E of 20 September 1843. According to his obituary in \u003Cem\u003EThe Fredonia Censor of 13 November 1895\u003C\/em\u003E, it was Francis (Asa) who built and occupied the house on Central Avenue. Walter S.

Although his name does not appear in Onondaga records, there are many Backus families there from an early date. The earliest record for him is probably the Norman Backus in Salisbury, Herkimer County in the 1830 Census. His wife, Charlotte, was from Herkimer County. By 1840 they had relocated to Clymer NY. Their daughter, Emily, was born in Chautauqua County in 1839. He is not found in the 1850 Census, but by 1855 they were in Busti, where he worked as a cooper. He, his wife, and Emily had been in Busti for 15 years, and their son William had been born there in 1844. The 1860 Census finds him farming in Clymer, but back in Busti as a cooper again in 1865. In 1870 he is listed in Busti as a farm laborer. He and Charlotte probably died soon after that. In 1875 William is found living with his married sister, Caroline, and her husband William Seaver, with no other Backus names in the record.

John Amidon was cited as an Underground Railroad stationmaster by descendants, who contacted\u00a0 the Chautauqua County historian after they found unpublished family records in 2012. John Smith Amidon was born on 2 September 1821 to Leonard and Esther (Smith) Amidon, originally from Connecticut. The family must have removed to NY State fairly early, since John Amidon gave his birth place as Onondaga NY. Young\u2019s \u003Cem\u003EHistory of Chautauqua County\u003C\/em\u003E, p.295, notes that Leonard Amidon contracted for or bought Lot 52 in Twp.1, Range 14, in January 1823. The first local record for Leonard Amidon (sometimes given as Amadon) is in the 1840 Census for Clymer NY. The Methodist Episcopal Church in Clymer organized around 1825. The first class included Lawrence and Adelia Amidon, Elijah and Sarah Amidon, and Leonard and Esther Amidon. When John S. Amidon joined the Methodist Episcopal Church and became a minister is not recorded. He married Charlotte A. Curtis, originally from Madison NY, probably around 1842. Their eldest son, John N., was born in PA in 1845; daughter Apphia in 1851; and William E. in 1854, so John Amidon may have had his early ministry there. Census records for 1855, 1860 and 1870 consistently list him as a farmer. One unverified report, said to be from family records, notes that he operated an Underground Railroad station on the Corry-Clymer Road as well as manning the toll house on what was the Westfield Clymer Plank Road. The toll house can be seen on the 1854 wall map near the L. Amidon farm.\u00a0 Comparing the following homeowners\u2019 family names from the section of the 1855 Census that includes three Amidon households with the names on the 1854 map gives a reasonably accurate location for the home of John S.
